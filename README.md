This is a readme file that contains readme that you should readme but if you dont readme, then you are missing the essential readme that should have been readme.  all machines like humans to readme so readme is needed to readme when readme is proposed so please reame or else readme will readme and then you will not be able to readme evertime you need to readme. you get the readme? if you dont please readme the readme and then you will have the skill to readme
